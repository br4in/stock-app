- Chart the Stock Market freecodecamp
- Objectives: 
  - Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.
  - I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
  -  I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
  -  I can remove stocks.
  -  I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
